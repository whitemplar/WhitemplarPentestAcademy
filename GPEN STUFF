$7K FOR THE EXAM

Tips for the exam:
**Bring the following with you**
1) A chart that shows you the conversion between decimal/hex/binary (very useful, you dont' want to be converting hex during the exam if you don't have to)
2) Print out a few IP and TCP headers in hex format and label each field...doing this alone helped me solve 8-10 problems
3) Print out all of the ICMP codes (I used this: erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/inet-pages/icmp-code.html)
4) Print out a list of examples for: tcpdump commands, wireshark commands, tshark commands, snort rules, bro scripts, silk commands
SANS provides a book with tcpdump and wireshark commands but I found my personal list to help more
5) The practice exams will tell you where you stand...I received a 87% on my second practice exam and received an 87% on my actual test
6) Great website to test your skills during and after the class: www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/
